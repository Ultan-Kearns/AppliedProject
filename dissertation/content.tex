\chapter*{About This Project}
\paragraph{Analysis of This Project: }
%ADD references TO MERN STACK AND PYTHON HERE
This project was designed by me for the module Applied Project \& Dissertation with the purpose being
to complete an online banking system using a MERN(Mongo, Express, React \& Node) stack.
The project should allow user to login, view statements, takeout loans, perform transactions and
will show the user there monthly and yearly expenditures using graphs. The project will also be
secure and utilize user accounts using a Mongo Database to ensure that the users account is secure.
\\*
\\*
The main purpose of this project is to utilize the MERN stack to provide a full and rich user
experience and to provide a secure, intuitive and polished online banking system.  The project
will also utilize Python scripts to perform statistical analysis on user expenditure and income
and will provide an estimate of how much money the user should have for the month based upon previous
monthly expenditure.
\\*
\\*
This project was designed to be a stand alone application where a user can perform all their
banking needs without any other software.  The user should be find the UI intuitive and the
features helpful.
\\*
\\*
This project will link many disparate technologies together for the purpose of providing the user
with the features they need.  I plan to use this project to show the skills I have attained during
my course and to learn a new framework(React). I also plan to improve and cultivate my skills
using new technologies such as various Python libraries and React. This project is stored on a GitHub
repository the link to which can be found in the appendix.
\paragraph{Authors: }
My name is \textbf{Ultan Kearns}, I am a fourth year student at GMIT. I have never used
React or \LaTeX\  before but I plan to learn a lot about these technologies during the course of this project.


\chapter{Introduction}

\section {Why A MERN stack?}
In this section I will be discussing why I chose a MERN stack, what it is, and how I will utilize it.
\begin{center}
  \begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/mern.jpeg}
    \caption{MERN Logo}
    \label{fig: Image of MERN stack logo}
  \end{figure}
\end{center}
There are many reasons why I have chosen to use a MERN stack for this
application the main one is because it provides a framework for a full stack
application.
MERN stands for \textbf{Mongo - For the database Back-End(Hosted on Mlab, all user info is stored here),
Express - A web application framework
host a server in a relatively short time compared to other methods
, ReactJS for asynchronous JS \& Node - For the server and also includes a package manager to install a variety of packages to provide certain functionalities.}
\cite{MERN}
\\
\subsection{Mongo}
As you have read above the MERN stack is very powerful in creating a full-stack
application when used correctly.  The reason I chose the database Mongo is because
it offers an open source alternative to MySQL and other proprietary databases
\cite{Mongo}
and many companies seem to be migrating to it because it is open source and in
some cases may offer better performance than other databases.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Mongostat.png}
  \caption{Mongo Usage}
  \label{fig: Mongo usage statistics}
\end{figure}
\cite{Survey}
Mongo is easy to learn as it stores it's data in JSON format and is schemaless, that is the user
defines their own schemas. I have also used it for 2 other projects in Angular and find it an
easy database to use in relation to projects.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/Mongo.jpg}
  \caption{Mongo Logo}
  \label{fig: Image of Mongo Logo}
\end{figure} \cite{MongoImage}
\\
\subsection{Express}
I chose to use Express because it is a very useful framework when creating a server.
It is very helpful when pulling data from the server and displaying it to the client
it is also very scalable and offers good security when used properly.  It is also very
easy to setup and can be connected to the MLab database in minutes upon starting the
project.  I have also used this server before and have a bit of experience with it and
found it very helpful in the projects I used it for, which were a messaging forum and an
E-commerce application both using MEAN(Mongo,Express,Angular \& Node) stacks.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/express.png}
  \caption{Express JS}
  \label{fig: Image of Express Logo}
\end{figure}
\cite{ExpressImage}
\\
\subsection{React}
I also chose this project because I have zero experience in ReactJS and since
it's such an up and coming framework I decided on it for this project. It also
offers many features and libraries which are desirable when programming a user
interface to ensure the user finds the application intuitive and easy to use.
ReactJS also utilizes modular programming for components which makes designing
web applications far easier than just using HTML, CSS \& Javascript. React is
also very fast at rendering pages so that the user will not experience a major
delay in accessing information.
\\
\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/react.png}
  \caption{React}
  \label{fig: Image of React Logo}
\end{figure} \cite{ReactImage}
\\
\subsection{Node JS}
The reason I chose Node JS was because it offers a great package manager which can be
used to improve productivity on my part and also the applications security, UI,
UX and various other aspects of the application.  I debated using Yarn for this
project but settled on Node because it was already installed on my laptop.  Node
is a very useful tool when developing full-stack applications and was very helpful
in installing tools and libraries for react.  Node is also very good for getting a server
up and running in a few minutes and handles HTTP requests very well.

\section{Why a banking application?}
In this section I will discuss why I chose to do a banking application of all things for my final year project.
\subsection{Explanation of Why I Chose This Project}
A banking application is broad in scope and offers many questions to the developer
such as how can I optimize load times and how can I ensure user data is secure.
I think questions such as these offer the potential for growth in the areas of
design and problem solving - which are two of the most major skills a software
developer can possess. I feel that an application such as a multi-user banking
system can be beneficial to my career and help to improve my skills as a developer.
Banking applications also have the potential to offer a wide array of features and
are ubiquitous in the real world, think major banks such as AIB \& Bank of Ireland.
Banking systems also offer a broad range of problems such as security, design
and usability.
\\
\subsection{My Contention With Existing Online Banking Systems \& How I Plan To Improve Upon Them}
The current generation of online banking systems or at least the ones I have used
tend to have a variety of problems.  These problems are glaringly obvious to most
people and the main problems include but are not limited to: usability, appearance, lack of
personalization \& lack of information given to user.  I will how I plan to solve each of
these problems below:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Usability:} I aim to provide an intuitive and cutting-edge user
interface using the latest react libraries to provide the user with an easy to
understand banking application.  All features will be easily navigated to using
a navigation bar and I will aim to make features as obvious as possible to the user.
\item \textbf{Appearance:} The UI of the modern day online banking system tends
to be absolutely depressing.  I aim to reduce this by adding in a responsive UI
and to offer the user a vibrant online banking experience.
\item \textbf{Lack of personalization:} I aim to make this application very personal
to the user by adding in personalized expenditure charts and giving the user a
unique and inimitable banking experience.
\item \textbf{Lack of information:} Modern banking applications sometimes display
a lack of information given to the user.  I plan to solve this by offering the user
expenditure charts, reports and also by sending automated emails to them when
their account balance falls below a user specified number.
\end{itemize}
\section{Requirements}
Below I will include the requirements for this application and expand upon them.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiple Users:} This application must allow multiple users to
execute simultaneous banking and user sessions must be independent of each
other.
\item \textbf{Secure:} Database information must be encrypted
\item \textbf{Accurate:} All statements and user information must be accurate.
\item \textbf{Login/Logout} The user must be able to login and logout
\item \textbf{information}: The user must be able to view all information related
to them (eg: statements, withdrawal dates etc.)
\item \textbf{Graphs/Charts}: The banking app must display expenditures and
credit in graphs and charts generated from python scripts
\item \textbf{Emails} The application must be able to email the user a forgot
password if they forgot their password and also be able to email the user if
budget controls are turned on.
\item \textbf{Register} The user must be able to register new accounts using
an email and password also ensure that it cannot be an email that already exists.
\item \textbf{Delete account} The user must be able to terminate their account
and all information that exists about the user must be purged from the server.
\item \textbf{Change information} The user must be able to update all their personal
information in relation to their account except obviously banking statements and
balances.
\item \textbf{User sessions} The application must use cookies to maintain a
user session and ensure that the cookies do not last more than a specified time-frame
max of a day.
\end{itemize}
\section{Outline of chapters}
Below I will outline the chapters that my Dissertation is broken up into and
give a brief outline of each one.

\section{Online Banking}
Online banking is very relevant in today's modern world, the ease of access which
the digital age allows us has led to a significant amount of banking being done
online.  Think of how many inconveniences have been shed away by the advent of online
banking, no longer do people have to wait in line for ages at the bank to take out loans
or to view their statements as all this can be done online or with the help of computers.
Every modern bank now has some form of website which allows their customers to do
all their daily tasks related to banking online.  In this chapter I will discuss the
advantages, disadvantages and overall affect of online banking.
\section{History of Online Banking}
This section will discuss the history of online banking where it came from and how
it has evolved throughout the ages.
\subsection{Definition of Online Banking}
The definition of online banking includes any form of electronic payment systems
that allows the customer or business entity to conduct financial transactions
via a financial institutions website or application.
\subsection{The Beginning}
The metamorphosis of the old brick and mortar banks to the click and mortar banks of
today all started as early as the 1980s \cite{HistoryBanking}. The earliest version
of the online presence of banking took place in none other than New York City, New York,
USA.  Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Chemical Bank and manufacturers Hanover became the
first banks to introduce on online banking system in 1981.\cite{HistoryBanking}
Then in 1983 the Bank of Scotland became the first bank in the UK to offer an
internet banking service which was called Homelink to UK customers.People had to
use their phones and their televisions to manage their online banking as computers
where not as ubiquitous at this time \cite{HistoryBanking} It was not until 1994
that a bank in the USA called the Stanford Federal Credit Union began to offer online
banking services to all of its customers \cite{HistoryBanking}.In the year 2006 80\% of US banks had began to offer
some variation of online banking \cite{HistoryBanking}.
It was a slow process to move from the tried and true brick and mortar banking that the majority of the public
were,if not entirely satisfied with, were familiar with and accustomed to through decades of
usage. The move from brick and mortar to click and mortar was not all advantages, there were many issues
which had to be addressed such as ease of access, security and the education of the public about phishing scams
and various other crimes which can occur by storing information online.  Some banks offered advice to the elderly
and people who may not know so much about computers advice in an attempt to cut down on online banking crimes I have referenced an example of one such site targeting the elderly to dispense such advice \cite{BOIElderly}
\section{Advantages of Online Banking}
Here I will discuss the numerous advantages that online banking offers.
\subsection{Convenience}
There are many advantages to online banking which I will discuss in this section
the most prominent of these advantages is convenience.  Bank customers no longer
have to drive or walk to the bank or to an ATM to check their balance and with online
payments customers will never have to withdraw money unnecessarily.  You can now
easily transfer money between accounts online and set up standing payments to pay
your bills which is a lifesaver for some people. You can also use your mobile to
view your balance and statements anywhere using mobile data and online banking applications,
this allows users to access their account from anywhere in the world depending on the
availability of reception.
\subsection{Speed}
The speed of which a bank customer can access their account information is now
determined by the speed of their internet.  Before the advent of online banking
you would have to wait in line at an ATM to see your statements or to withdraw
money to pay your bills, now that online banking has become virtually ubiquitous
in the modern world you no longer have to wait in lines to perform activities and
tasks relating to banking.
\subsection{Competition}
The rise of online banking means that banks are constantly trying to out do each
other in terms of their banking applications.  The customer now has much more choice
in choosing banks since the advent of online banking. The advent of online banking has
led to some banks maintaining only an online presence.\cite{OnlineBanking}
\subsection{Creation of Jobs}
The switch from physical banking to digital banking has created numerous jobs
in the software industry especially in terms of cyber-security as banks increasingly
worry about security breaches and hacks.  Any hacks that occur are viewed as the fault
of the bank and allows many customers to migrate to other banks, that is why many banks
spend a lot of money to secure data on their servers which creates jobs and stimulates
the economy.
\section{Disadvantages of Online Banking}
Here I will discuss the numerous disadvantages of online banking.
\subsection{Security}
Storing details in a digital environment is a lot less secure than storing them
in a non digital format.  This happens because the data is stored on a server
and if phishing scams getting a user's password are successful they could find that
their bank account has been drained of money.  There are many other forms of attacks
which could occur such as keylogging, network monitoring and on public networks
your data is far less secure.  Although banks have taken many counter measures
to prevent such attacks from occurring sometimes they slip through the cracks of
cyber-security analysts\cite{BankHacks}.  Most people find that a little less security is a fair
trade-off for the convenience online banking provides.
\subsection{Layoff of Bank Employees}
As the migration of banking from physical to digital takes place it leads to
a surplus of banking employees which are made redundant.  This occurs because
of the ease of access of online banking and this limits the need for more
tellers in many banks.
\subsection{Increased Crime}
As banks migrate there is an increase of cyber-criminals who try to gain access
to the banks.  According to one article 25\% of all malware hits financial services
\cite{ForbesBankHack}.  This increase of crime leads to an increased number of compromised
accounts on a banks server.
\section{The Overall Effect of Online Banking}
The overall effect of online banking has had a stunning impact on our world.
The availability of a bank 24/7 has provided countless benefits to both consumers
and businesses alike.  The advantages in my mind as in the minds of many others
far outweigh the disadvantages of online banking.
\chapter{Methodology}
\section{Overview of Methodology}
In this project I utilized the Agile methodology, I used Sprints to coordinate my work and after each sprint I performed
module testing and regression testing.  I also used Test Driven Development which involves writing tests and writing just
enough code to make them pass and then going back and refactoring the code.
\section{Agile}
This section will discuss the Agile methodology which was utilized in the development of this application and how it will be utilized in the development of this application.
\subsection{What is Agile?}
Agile is a software development methodology which according to the agile manifesto website \cite{Agile} favours: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
Working software over comprehensive documentation,
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation,
Responding to change over following a plan".  There are many variations of agile \cite{VariationsofAgile} such as Scrum, XP, Kanban and many more. All Agile methodologies follow the same principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto\cite{Agile} For the purposes of this project I'll be using Kanban.  All Agile methodologies stress
continuous improvement and incremental delivery.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/agile.jpg}
  \caption{Agile}
  \label{fig: Image of Agile Lifecycle}
\end{figure}
\\
\cite{AgileImage}
\subsection{Why Kanban?}
Kanban \cite{Kanban} allows for a visualized workflow and was also easy to implement into the project. It allows for incremental development and a continuous improvement of features.  In contrast to waterfall, Agile methodologies also allow the developer to go back and improve upon features.  In summary Kanban offered me a visualized workflow and also allowed me to divide my sprints into daily or weekly tasks which I could complete in a relatively short time.
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.1\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=3\linewidth]{img/kanban.png}
\caption{Image of Kanban board from wikipedia}
\label{fig:Image of Kanban board}
\end{wrapfigure}
\subsection{How I Applied Agile To This Project}
During this project I used a Kanban board on Github \cite{KanbanBoard} to coordinate
my sprints(Backlog) and added the issues that needed to be finished to the Kanban board.   When an issue was added it was automatically moved to the "To Do" section of the Kanban board when it was in progress it was moved to the "in progress" section and finally when it was done I moved it to the "Done" section of the Kanban board.  The Kanban board helped create a visualized workflow which helped productivity as I could visualize which issues I would be working on that day and also I could coordinate
the Kanban board with my sprints to segregate work I needed to accomplish in a fixed
time-frame.
\section{Test Driven Development (TDD)}
This section will discuss Test Driven Development and what it is and how it will be applied to the development process.
\subsection{What Is Test Driven Development?}
Test Driven Development or TDD is a form of testing during development which focuses on writing the tests of a function before coding it and then writing enough code to make sure that it passes the test and then going back and refactoring it\cite{TDD}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/tdd.jpg}
  \caption{TDD}
  \label{fig: Image of Test Driven Development}
\end{figure}
\\
\cite{TDDImage}
\subsection{How I Applied Test Driven Development To This Project}
I wrote simple tests as I developed this code, for example for the statements section I wrote a test such as "Output only the statements of the user, output must be in form of location, cost, name, date" I then proceeded to write just enough code to make it pass and then went back and refactored it.
\section{Time Management}
This section discusses how I managed my time while juggling multiple projects.
\subsection{How I Handled Multiple Projects}
I was able to handle multiple projects at a time by defining sprints in my final year project and assigning myself daily tasks using the Kanban Board, sometimes I had issues in completing these daily tasks but I always tried to complete them in a timely and effective manner.  Sometimes I experienced scope-creep with a task where I had to add more features to the task to make the project viable.
\subsection{Issues I Faced With Time Management}
I faced some issues with time management as the workload was fairly heavy, I had to cut some projects short and leave out some features of various projects to ensure that all projects were completed to an acceptable level.
\section{Version Control}
This section will discuss version control and how I managed to develop this project by utilizing Github and Git.
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.1\textwidth}
\includegraphics[width=3\linewidth]{img/github}
\caption{Github Logo from github.com}
\label{fig:wrapfig}
\end{wrapfigure}
I used GitHub to manage the versions of this application and to incrementally add code to my repository.
I also used GitHub for the Kanban board and to manage any issues that arose during the course of development.
\\
Github also allowed me to have multiple branches, one of which I used for all code that had been tested and was proven to work called Master and another where I implemented and tested desirable features, this branch I called Feature.  The compartmentalization of tested and untested code helped me a lot during the course of development as it allowed me to perform accurate regression tests and module tests which made
 debugging the application a lot easier.
\\
  Github also served as a backup of all my code in case of hard drive errors, hardware failures or various other issues that may arise.  Github also allowed me to revert back to previous versions of the project just in case I had made a mistake in the code and needed to revert back to a working version.  Github also served to provide me with a place were I could log any issues I had with the project and also allowed me to divide my sprints into daily or weekly tasks since the sprints were usually set over the course of a few days.
\chapter{Technical Review}
\section{Intro}
In this chapter I will explore the technologies I used in this project and why I used them.  I will also explain how the technologies were implemented and how they were utilized to ensure that the online banking application was fully functional.  I will also review the technologies I used in this project and show how each technology provided a desired functionality which would be paramount to achieving a fully fledged robust, secure and overall user-friendly baking system.
\section{MERN Stack}
The MERN stack is a technology which is used to make full-stack web applications.  Each component in a MERN stack has a specific function to allow for full-stack development.  The MERN stack is widely used in industry and is composed of the following components:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item MongoDB - For storing items in a database
  \item Express - Provides a web application framework
  \item React - A JavaScript library for building UI
  \item NodeJs - For server architecture and Back-End
\end{itemize}
\subsection{About MongoDB}
MongoDB is a document database that is scalable and flexible, it provides the user with a litany of various functions to perform actions on data stored in the database.  MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents which means the fields can vary between documents and that the structure of the data can morph over time.  The use of JSON-like objects makes the data very easy to access and to manipulate for example say I had the following object:
\begin{minted}{json}
{
  "person": {
    "name": "ultan"
  }
}
\end{minted}
Here if I wanted to acess the given persons name the only command I would have to execute would be \begin{minted}{js}
  person.name();
\end{minted}
I will explore the simplicity of JSON more in the JSON section but it is a rather pertinent point about MongoDB and it is one of the reasons why I chose to use MongoDB in this project.
\\
 In addition to all of the above advantages of MongoDB a major factor in choosing it for this project is that it is open-source which means it is free to use, and as typical of any open-source software it has attracted a strong community which provides support to other users of MongoDB and continues to provide feedback to improve Mongo.
\subsection{About Express}
Express is a Node.js web application framework which provides a myriad of desirable features for setting up a web sever.  Express helped me set-up a fully functional web application in a timely manner.  I also utilized Express to provide routing to multiple paths and to retrieve, delete, create \& update various information stored on my Mongo database.  I found Express very easy to setup and to use and the developers of Express provided comprehensive and very informative documentation on Express which can be found on their website\cite{ExpressDocs}
\\
 Express was able to return data I needed in JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) format and using the returned information I could then output the returned results to the user for purposes such as: to provide news \& to show the user their information.  I could also pass through parameters in the path and find information on a certain user or piece of data, this was very important for features such as logging the user in to the system as I had to compare the username and password and ensure both were correct.
 \\
 In conclusion Express provided a thin layer over Node.js to provide the application with features such as routing and also allows the developer to have a server up and running in minutes.  Express provided a lot of functionality to the banking application and also allowed me to create, read, update \& delete data, all of these are required for a fully fledged banking application in the 21st century.
\subsection{About React}
ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces\cite{React} React is maintained by Facebook and numerous other companies and independent developers.  React can be used to create user friendly single-page applications which is perfect for an online banking system which is being designed with usability and accessibility in mind.  React has numerous libraries which can be used such as Axios\cite{Axios}.
\\
 These libraries can be used for various functions such as ,in the case of Axios, performing routing.  ReactJS also allows the developer to compartmentalize their code into different components each with it's own set of functions which makes the code far easier to debug as opposed to debugging a god class or god file.
\\
   React is also based on a language I have some familiarity with as I have used JavaScript for multiple web-based projects but I have never
   used React before, this use of JavaScript in React made it easy for me to dive-in and learn the framework.  React also has multiple
   libraries which can be utilized to provide a modern and minimalistic user interface without sacrificing functionality.
\\
React has been growing in popularity along with similar technologies such as Angular and multiple companies are using these technologies for their websites / applications.  A combination of all the above factors listed and Reacts growing popularity made it seem ideal for this project.
\subsection{About Node}
Node JS provided server-side architecture for this project.  NodeJS is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript run-time environment which is designed to be scalable and can be utilized to build network applications\cite{Node}.
\\
Node allows for concurrent connections to the server and can process multiple requests at a time.  NodeJS has a strong community and is open source and provides the developer with server-side architecture, it is also very powerful and can be used to perform HTTP requests such as: GET,PUT,POST,DELETE etc.
\\
 I utilized NodeJS in this project to retrieve data via HTTP requests either from MLAB or in the case of news stories, Reddit and various other news sites.
\\
Here is an example of how easy it is to start a basic web application with Node:
\\
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
const https = require("https");

app.get("/", function(req, res) {
  res.status(200).send("Server is up and running!");
});
var server = app.listen(8080, function() {
var host = server.address().address
  var port = server.address().port
  console.log("Example app listening at http://{$server}/{$port}:")
})
\end{minted}
\\
In the above example what will happen when the user searches the URL https://localhost:8080/ they will be greeted with the message "Server is up and running!", the 200 status indicates that the resource was retrieved successfully.
\section{Testing}
This section will discuss how the application was tested.
\subsection{Selenium}
Selenium is a browser add-on which automates the browser and allows the user to create tests which will monitor the users actions performed and log them so that these tests can be run and re-run with the click of a button.  Selenium helped greatly in the development of this application and freed up time I would have used to perform extensive manual testing and allowed me to add a litany of new features to this application.
\section{React Libraries / JavaScript Libraries}
This application uses many libraries to provide extra features for the user and to enhance the applications functionality, I will discuss the libraries used in this section and explain what they do and why they were used.
\subsection{Axios}
Axios is a promise based HTTP client for node.js\cite{Axios}.  I used Axios in this project to send HTTP requests from the Front-End of the application to the NodeJS server.  Axios allowed me to retrieve information from various paths and return that information to the user, and to update, delete and create new information.  I used Axios to achieve full CRUD(Create, read, update \& delete) functionality.
\subsection{React Helmet}
React-helmet is a reusable react component that can manage the document head of various components, it allows the developer to define HTML tags such as title and outputs them to the browser\cite{ReactHelmet}.
\subsection{Create-React-App}
Create-React-App allows the developer to quick-start a React application without having to worry about build-options or anything else, it's as simple as running "create-react-app new app" in the terminal or CLI(Command line interface)\cite{CreateReactApp}.
\subsection{Annyang}
Annyang is a speech recognition library which I utilized in this project to provide voice navigation through components.  This library was extremely easy to set-up and was very interesting to review Annyangs code.  Sadly due to library limitations Annyang only works on Google Chrome and is unavailable on Firefox and other browsers.  I used Annyang to describe various vocal commands and have the app continuously listening.
\section{Third Party APIs}
This application uses a handful of APIs to accomplish tasks from pulling news articles from various sources to providing the user with stock market information.  I will discuss the APIs used in the application below.
\subsection{NodeMailer}
NodeMailer is a module for NodeJS that allows the developer to set up an automated email system to send the user personalized emails which could be used to inform user of new features, services etc. For this project I will use it to allow the user to reset their password.
\subsection{News API}
News API is a REST API which searches the web for news stories and retrieves headlines from a variety of websites\cite{NewsAPI}.  News API allows the developer to search by keywords and phrases, dates published, source name and various other parameters which may be relevant to the article in questions.
\subsection{Reddit}
I used the Reddit API to retrieve latest financial news and displayed them to the user.  The Reddit API allows the developer to read in JSON from Reddit and to parse it and output it to the user.
\subsection{AlphaVantage}
AlphaVantage is an API to get financial information such as stock, exchange rates and cryptocurrency prices in real-time as well as providing historic information.  I utilized AlphaVantage in this application to provide the user with the latest exchange rates for currencies and to provide the user with information about the stock market.

\section{Architecture}
This section describes the architecture of the application and what design patterns were used in development and why.
\subsection{REST(Representational State Transfer)}
REST is an architectural design that was first hypothesized in Roy Fielding's dissertation\cite{Fielding}.  REST has six constraints which must be met for an application to be considered "RESTful" these are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Client/Server must be independent: The idea behind this principle is that by separating the UI from the Back-End logic we create a more portable application and also it improves scalability by simplifying the server logic.
  \item Stateless:  Every request from the client to the server must contain all pertinent information to understand the user's request, session state is maintained on the client side.
  \item Cacheable: Data received must be labelled cacheable or non-cacheable.  If it is labelled as cacheable the client may reuse the data.
  \item Uniform Interface: System architecture is simplified and improved by applying the software principle of generality.
  \item Layered System: The layered system allows for a hierarchical layer of components in which components can interact with certain components.  Components are unaware of other components besides the component with which they are interacting.
\end{itemize}
\section{Security}
This section describes the various ways the application conforms to security standards and how they were applied and why.
\subsection{OpenSSL}
OpenSSL is a toolkit for providing TLS(Transport Layer Security) \& SSL(Secure Socket Layer) protocols.  It is also a cryptography library which can be used to enhance the applications security.  I used OpenSSL to generate a certificate for the Node server to provide an extra layer of security for the user.
\\
\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/tls.png}
  \caption{TLS.}
  \label{fig: How TLS Works}
\end{figure}
\cite{TLS}
\subsection{SHA256}
SHA256 stands for Secure Hashing Algorithm 256 which is used as a one way function which means that data which is hashed using this algorithm is impossible to revert into it's original form\cite{SHA256}.  I used the SHA256 algorithm to encrypt and secure user passwords stored in the database and to ensure that the passwords were not stored in plaintext for extra security.
\subsection{Twilio}
Twilio is a cloud communication platform which developers can utilize to send text messages, phone calls and perform various functions through their service\cite{Twilio}. I utilized Twilio for this projects 2 factor authentication to send a random 10 digit password to the users phone to authenticate their login which provides extra security for the user.
\section{Database}
I will discuss the database utilized to maintain user information and any pertinent information deemed relevant to the system.
\subsection{MLAB}
MLAB is a DaaS(Database as a service) platform and provides a free hosting environment for my applications database\cite{MLAB}.  The reason I chose MLAB is that it's free and it is easy to setup multiple separate schemas which can then be accessed through connecting to the database via the NodeJS server.  All the relevant data to the banking application is stored on MLAB.  MLAB utilizes a Mongo database and allows the user to connect to the database using a username and password.


\section{Languages}
In this section I will list and describe the languages utilized in this application and explain why they were used.
\subsection{Javascript}
JavaScript is a lightweight programming language which is interpreted and is compiled just in time\cite{JavaScript}.  It is a very popular language for web developers as it is Turing Complete and allows the developer to manipulate the DOM(Document Object Model) programmatically.
\\
\\
 I used JavaScript for performing various functions which were expected from an online banking application such as: cycling through a users transactions, outputting user data, comparing inputted values to values retrieved from the server for login, checking if a user already exists etc.
 \\
 \\
 In short JavaScript provided me with a full Turing Complete language to code the logic of the online banking application. Here is an example of some JavaScript code:
 \begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
   name = "Ultan"
   //prints Hello, Ultan
   print("Hello, " + name);
   a = 1
   b = 2
   //prints 3
   print(a + b)
   //prints Hello, Ultan1
   print("Hello, " + name + a)

 \end{minted}
\subsection{HTML(Hyper-Text Markup Language)}
Hyper-Text Markup Language or HTML is a markup language and is the standard for creating web pages\cite{HTML}.  I used HTML to structure my web page and insert various elements into the web pages such as: images, headers, paragraphs etc.
\\
\\
Below I will include a very basic HTML page:
\begin{minted}{HTML}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title> You'll find me on your tab!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a header</h1>
<p>Hello world! This is HTML</p>
</body>
</html>
\end{minted}
\\
All valid HTML pages must have a DOCTYPE html declaration, html tag, head tag, and a body tag.  Any tag which is opened must be closed.
\section{Documentation}
In this section I will discuss how I wrote the documentation detailing the development,design of this application, and all other relevant artefacts to the application.
\subsection{\LaTeX}
\LaTeX \hspace{0.1cm} is a typesetting system that provides various features for designing and writing high quality documentation\cite{Latex}.  \LaTeX\hspace{0.1cm} has become the de facto standard for Academic publications and is open-source. Having never use \LaTeX\hspace{0.1cm} before I found it very easy to setup and get started, it also made referencing a lot easier and made generating tables of contents \& figures very simple.
\\
The reason I chose \LaTeX \hspace{0.1cm} to write this dissertation apart from the above reasons listed, was because it helps to create high quality, Academic style papers with minimal onus placed upon the user.
\\
\LaTeX \hspace{0.1cm} also has extremely useful packages which can be used to provide numerous functionality.
\section{Styles}
This section describes how the applications UI(User Interface) was styled to provide a pleasant and intuitive experience for the user.
\subsection{Cascading Style Sheets(CSS)}
CSS allowed me to style the HTML pages and to make them look how I wanted them to look.  CSS describes how the HTML is supposed to look when the browser loads a web page.
\\
Heres an example of CSS:
\begin{minted}{CSS}
  h1{
    //turns color of all h1 elements red
    color:red;
    //centers the text of h1
    text-align:center;
    //changes font-size to 21px
    font-size:21px;
    //These are just a small sample of things you can change with CSS!
  }
\end{minted}
\subsection{React Bootstrap}
React Bootstrap is a Front-End framework for React that provides the developer with a number of components which can be used to create a modern looking and intuitive user-interface.
\section{Cloud}
This section details the cloud architecture utilized to host this application.
\subsection{Google Cloud Platform}
Google Cloud Platform is an Infrastructure as a service(IaaS) platform which I will use to host my application and server to allow users to connect to the application remotely\cite{GoogleCloudPlatform}.  All logic will be performed by the user connection to the Google Cloud Platform server and utilizing the application.
\\
Google Cloud allows the developer to setup a virtual machine in minutes and it is in this way I plan to host my application.  I will create a VM(virtual machine) on Google Cloud and open the ports necessary for the end user to communicate with the application.  After this is done the user will only need to type in the IP address of the machine and the port they wish to connect to(in our case port:3000) to be able to access the application.
\\
  The reason I chose Google Cloud Platform is because I have used AWS(Amazon Web Services) and Azure(Microsoft's cloud platform) before and wanted to try a variety of cloud platforms to gain familiarity and experience with a variety of cloud functions and platforms.
\subsection{Docker}
Docker aims to simplify and accelerate workflows for applications and allows the developer to build and share their applications as well as allowing them to deploy and ship their applications easily\cite{Docker}.  Docker uses containerization to manage the applications which it hosts.
\\
 The containers are portable and can run on any host.  Docker automatically releases a new build of the project every time a new commit is pushed to the master branch, it is in this why that docker allows for continuous integration of new components for the application and a continuous delivery of new updates to the application.  Docker is extremely useful for Agile development as continuous integration and delivery are an integral part of the Agile methodology.
\\
  I have never used Docker before but I chose to use it for this project as it is rapidly growing in popularity and it is extremely useful in today's industry as companies focus on releasing patches and updates to the user as soon as they are ready.
\chapter{System Design}
\section{Chapter Introduction}
In this section I will discuss the architecture of the application both in terms of Front-End and Back-End.
I will discuss each component individually and the reasoning for its existence.  I will also discuss how
the Front-End communicates with the Back-End, how I designed the application with a strong focus on UX(User Experience)
and how I improved upon existing paradigms in online banking.  The system is designed to be robust and to be as
error prone as possible, I achieved this to the best of my abilities by using TDD(Test Driven Development) and an
Agile methodology.
\subsection{Introduction to System}
This application was made using React which is a web-application framework for building user interfaces,
for the purposes of my application I used it to build a SPA(Single Page Application) which has multiple
advantages over a standard webpage, I will list the advantages here:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Single Page Applications load faster and are more responsive
  \item Single Page Applications cache data very effectively, thus decreasing load times
  \item Creates a more user friendly experience
  \item Easier to debug as their are many tools such as React Developer Tools.
\end{itemize}
The system is made up of 11 components some of which share the same cascading stylesheets for
a more uniform look and to create a better user experience.
\\
The system's Back-End was written using NodeJS and utilizes the ExpressJS library
which offers the developer a wide range of additional features.
\section{Front End Architecture}
Here I will describe the architecture of the project in great technical detail, listing components and explaining their functionality and the why the components were developed.
\subsection{List of Components}
Each of the following subsections will describe the anatomy of each component and will discuss their purpose and the code used to implement each component.
\subsection{Login}
The login component is the component that the user first sees when starting the application.  The component features an introduction which has white text on a black background and prompts the user to "Login to experience next generation banking".  In addition to this there is a paragraph which states "Please enter your username and password below and we'll redirect you to your account component"  below this paragraph are two input boxes which prompt the user to enter their username and password respectively.  When the user enters the correct password they are redirected to their accounts component, however if the password or username is entered incorrectly they are alerted by means of a JavaScript alert that their password or username is wrong.  In addition to the above stated there are three buttons one which says "Register" which navigates to the register component another which says "Forgot Password" which will navigate to the Forgot component and one which says "Login".  Once the user has entered the correct username and password they can hit the login button to be redirected to the main application homepage if they can enter the right 2fa code which is sent to their phone.  The user cannot enter in a components name and gain access to the component unless logged in.  I accomplished the login feature by utilizing code from a previous project's function which I had coded:
%got flags from https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/129383/break-lines-in-minted-code
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
const axios = require("axios").default;
const sha256 = require("js-sha256");
const random = this.generateRandom();
axios
  .get(
    "https://localhost:8080/api/users/" +
      this.state.username.toLowerCase() +
      "/" +
      sha256(this.state.password) +
      "/" +
      random
  )
  .then(function(res) {
    if (res.data !== "null") {
      //do axios.get in here
      sessionStorage.setItem("username", res.data.name);
      sessionStorage.setItem("email", res.data._id);
      sessionStorage.setItem("number", res.data.number);
      var answer = "";
      // saves money for twilio when I keep asking user for answer rather than send tonnes of sms
      while (answer != null) {
        answer = window.prompt("Enter 2fa code sent to your phone");
        if (answer === random) {
          ReactDOM.render(<Nav />, document.getElementById("root"));
        } else {
          alert("Wrong code entered, try logging in again");
        }
      }
    } else if (res.data === "null") {
      alert("Wrong username or password");
    } else if (res.data == null) {
      alert("Error logging in");
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    alert("Unexpected error: " + error);
  });

event.preventDefault();
};
\end{minted}
This function utilizes the generateRandom function which generates a 10 digit random number here is the function below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
generateRandom() {
  var random = "";
  for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    random += Math.floor(10 * Math.random());
  }
  return random;
}
\end{minted}
I had the idea to reuse the code and refactor it after reading Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas' book "The Pragmatic Programmer"\cite{PragmaticProgrammer}.  The above code basically says if there's an error throw a 500 which is a generic server error, if there is no such error and data is retrieved then respond with the data and return a 200 else return null and send back 404 to show that the requested resource was not found.  I handle all issues which may arise in the login component's logic:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
handleSubmitForm = event => {
  const axios = require("axios").default;
  const sha256 = require('js-sha256');
   axios
    .get(
      "https://localhost:8080/api/users/" +
        this.state.username.toLowerCase() +
        "/" +
        sha256(this.state.password)
    )
    .then(function(res) {
      console.log("TEST LOGIN " + res.data);
      //need to fix this so it shows error message
       if (res.data !== "null") {
        //store the username this will help the bank feel more personal
        sessionStorage.setItem("username", res.data.name);
        sessionStorage.setItem("email", res.data._id);
        ReactDOM.render(<Home />, document.getElementById("root"));
      }
      else if(res.data == "null"){
        alert("Wrong username or password")
      }
    }).catch(error =>{
      alert("Error logging in, check internet connection?")
    });

    console.log("Clicked")
  event.preventDefault();
};
\end{minted}
Here I send a get request to the Back-End URL to retrieve the user using the username and
hashed password(password was hashed using SHA256 security standard), next I check if data is null
if not login user and render the homepage I also set the sessionStorage items for other logic in the application.
If the username or password is wrong I return a message to the user telling them.  I also have a message if the
client is unable to communicate with the server.
\\

\begin{figure}[hb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/logincomponent.png}
\caption{Image of Login Component}
\label{fig:Image of login component}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Register}
The register component is accessible from the login component and is used when the
user wishes to create an account.  The register component features five inputs which
are: Username for the users email, password for the users password which is needed to login and is stored as a hash on the server,
full name which stores the users full name on the server, phone number which will be used for
2 factor authentication, and date of birth which when clicked will present the user with a calendar
so that they can select their date of birth.  The register component also allows the user to return
to the login component via a button whose value is "back", alternatively the user can chose the button that
says register which will send a POST request to the Back-End to create a new user account.  The username
in this application is a primary key which assures that the key must be unique, if the user chooses an
email which already exists on the server they will be greeted with a message saying "User already exists",
this is accomplished by the code below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
//check if user exists
axios
  .get("https://localhost:8080/api/users/" + this.state.username)
  .then(res => {
    //log res for testing
    console.log(res.data)
    if (res.data !== null) {
      alert("User already exists")
    }
  })
\end{minted}
which sends a get request to the Back-End and if that request brings back data we know that a
user with that key already exists otherwise it will allow the user to register and not return such
a message.
\\
The registration form also has form validation which are the following:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
this.state.number.length === 10 &&
this.state.name.length >= 5 &&
this.state.password.length >= 6 && this.username !== null && dob != null
\end{minted}
which state that the number length must be equal to ten, the name length must be greater than or equal to five, the password length must be greater than or equal to 6 and the username cannot be null if these requirements are not met the user will be met with a message saying "Form invalid, password length must be greater than 6 and number must have 10 digits and  name must have 5 or more characters and dob cannot be null".
\\
The Back-End code for the register function is listed below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
app.post("/api/users", function(req, res) {
  //check if user with same username exists use findById and change id to username
  var balance;
  if(req.body.balance == "")
  {
    balance = 0
  }
  else{
    balance = req.body.balance
  }
  Users.create({
    _id: req.body._id,
    password: req.body.password,
    name: req.body.name,
    number: req.body.number,
    dob: req.body.dob,
    balance: balance,
    iban: "IE",
    bic:""
  });
  res.status(201, "Resource created");
});
\end{minted}
The above code is used to create a new user object and save it to the database, if successful it returns a status 201 which means that a new user has been created.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/registercomponent.png}
\caption{Image of Register Component}
\label{fig:Image of register component}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Forgot}
The forgot component is a simple component which contains a few headings for the user and an input which prompts the user to enter their username.  The paragraph above the input field informs the user how to use the component.  If the send email button is hit and the username field is not blank then the component sends two axios requests one which is a post that sends a random password of 20 characters to the Back-End which will then update the user's password, the generated password is of course encrypted using SHA256 for extra security, the get request then sends a request to the Back-End to email the user their new password in plaintext, here is the code below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
axios.post("https://localhost:8080/api/users/" + sessionStorage.getItem("email") +  "/rand",rand).then(res=>{
  console.log(res)
});
axios
  .get("https://localhost:8080/api/emailuser/" + this.state.username + "/" + plaintext)
  .then(res => {
    console.log(res.data);
  });
alert("email sent to  " + this.state.username);
 event.preventDefault();
};
\end{minted}
The random password is generated by using JavaScript's random function to generate random numbers between one and ten as shown below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
var plaintext = ""
for(var i = 0; i < 20; i++)
{
  //generate 20 random numbers for password
  plaintext += Math.floor(10 * Math.random())
}
const hashed = sha256(plaintext)
alert("HASHED " + hashed)
const rand = {password: hashed}
\end{minted}
once the password is generated I then store the hashed plaintext in a constant variable called rand as I need the plaintext to send to the user, the plaintext is sent over the Back-End using NodeMailer and a Gmail account created for this project, the code was taken from an earlier project and was coded previously by myself here is the code below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
//template taken from earlier project
//https://github.com/Ultan-Kearns/eCommerceApp/blob/master/Back-End/Server.js
//Improved upon in this project
app.get("/api/emailuser/:id/:password", function(req, res, next) {
  Users.findById(req.params.id, function(err, data) {
    if (data == null)
      res.status(404, "User does not exist on this server", err);
    else if (data._id == req.params.id) {
      res.json(data);
      console.log(data)
      res.status(200, "User logged in!");
      var nodemailer = require("nodemailer");
      var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
        host: "smtp.gmail.com", // hostname
        service: "gmail",
        auth: {
          //login to email set up for this project
          user: "reactproject19@gmail.com",
          pass: "GMITreact19"
        },
        tls: {
          ciphers: "SSLv3"
        }
      });
      var mailOptions = {
        //Setting up which account to use for seending emails
        from: "reactproject19@gmail.com",
        to: data._id,
        subject: "Forgot Independent Banking password",
        text: "Here is your password for Independent Banking: " + req.params.password
      };

      //Send email or log errors if user doesn't exist
      transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info) {
        if (error) {
          console.log(error);
        } else {
          console.log("Sent Email to address: " + req.params.id);
        }
      });
    } else {
      console.log("EMAIL COULD NOT BE SENT");
      res.json("error email not sent");
    }
  });
});
\end{minted}
The email is encrypted and secured as per security standards

\label{fig:Image of Forgot Component}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Nav}
The NavigationBar component is a component that is specifically designed to handle the routing
for the application, the NavigationBar component consists of a number of links which will link
to various components as well as a logout button.
The NavigationBar component utilizes a react router and imports a component
called routes from the Services folder.  In routes all routes are defined in a switch which
wall map the various paths in this application to their components.  The navigation bar is responsive
and will hide the links in favour of a menu when the display gets too small.
\\
Code for routes:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}


import React from "react";

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Switch, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "../Components/Home";
import About from "../Components/About";
import Loans from "../Components/Loans";
import Headlines from "../Components/Headlines";
import Transactions from "../Components/Transactions";
import Statistics from "../Components/Statistics";
import Support from "../Components/Support";
import UserInfo from "../Components/UserInfo";
import Error from "../Components/Error";

export default class routes extends React.Component{
  render(){
    return(
      <Switch>
        {/* Routes are defined here */}
        <Route path="/" exact component={Home} />
        <Route path="/About" component={About} />
        <Route path="/Loans" component={Loans} />
        <Route path="/Transactions" component={Transactions} />
        <Route path="/UserInfo" component={UserInfo} />
        <Route path="/Statistics" component={Statistics} />
        <Route path="/Headlines" component={Headlines} />
        <Route path="/Support" component={Support} />
        {/*If route undefined redirect to error*/}
        <Route path="/*" component={Error} />
      </Switch>
    )
  }
}

\end{minted}
\\

          <Routes />
        </Router>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default NavigationBar;
\end{minted}
The reason for separating routes from the NavigationBar component is that it made the code easier
to debug and decreased the complexity of the component thus making for more maintainable
and well-written code.
\subsection{Loans}
The loans component greets the user with a header which says "Apply \& View Loans", the component is composed of
an input box with a button stating "Apply for Loan" which when clicked will retrieve the number the user entered
in the input box and send a request from the Front-End to the Back-End and create a new loan if the loan is considered
valid by the system.  The component also has another header "List of Loans" which will list all the users current loans
with a button that says "Pay Back" which when hit will pay back the users balance to the bank and create a statement detailing
the paying back of the loan.
\\
The loan if it is to be accepted must conform to the following stipulations:
\begin{itemize}
  \item User must have 25\% of the loan amount in their account for example to take out a loan of €100 the user must have a balance of €25 or greater.
  \item The user can have a maximum of five loans at any given time.
  \item The loan value must not exceed €500.
  \item The loan amount cannot equal €0 as it would be pointless.
\end{itemize}
If the loan stipulations are met then the Front-End executes the following code:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
if (
  this.state.amount !== "" &&
  answer === true &&
  parseInt(this.state.amount * 0.25) <=
    parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem("balance")) &&
  sessionStorage.getItem("openLoans") < 5 &&
  this.state.amount <= 500 &&
  this.state.amount > 0
) {
  const newLoan = {
    email: sessionStorage.getItem("email"),
    amount: this.state.amount,
    date: date,
    owedTo: "Independent Banking",
    status: "Open"
  };
  const newTransaction = {
    email: sessionStorage.getItem("email"),
    cost: this.state.amount,
    location: "IndependentBanking.com",
    name: sessionStorage.getItem("username"),
    date: date
  };
  axios
    .post("https://localhost:8080/api/transactions", newTransaction)
    .then(res => {
      console.log(res);
    });
  const newBalance = {
    balance:
      parseInt(this.state.amount) +
      parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem("balance"))
  };
  axios.post("https://localhost:8080/api/loans", newLoan).then(res => {
    console.log(res);
  });
  axios
    .post(
      "https://localhost:8080/api/users/" +
        sessionStorage.getItem("email") +
        "/balance",
      newBalance
    )
    .then(res => {
      console.log("TEST " + res);
      axios
        .get(
          "https://localhost:8080/api/users/" +
            sessionStorage.getItem("email")
        )
        .then(res => {
          sessionStorage.setItem("balance", res.data.balance);
          alert(
            "loan approved\n New balance is: " +
              sessionStorage.getItem("balance")
          );
        })
        .catch(error => {
          alert("Could not approve loan");
        });
      sessionStorage.setItem("openLoans", getOpenLoans());
      this.getUserLoans();
    });
} else {
  alert(
    "Loan aborted\n Reasons why this may happen:\nLoan cannot be null and user must have at least 25% of loan amount in balance\nUsers can only have 5 open loans at a time\n Loans must also be less than or equal to €500\nLoan must be greater than 0"
  );
}
event.preventDefault();
};
\end{minted}
Here I check if the loan stipulations are met, if they are then I create a new loan and a new transaction containing all pertinent information about this loan then via Axios I store this information on the Back-End.  Following this I update the users balance to add the loan amount to it, if the stipulations are not met we send the user an error message.
\\
After this code has been executed the component executes the getLoans() function which the component also executes when loaded which is used to get open loans, here is the code used to get the user loans down below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
getUserLoans() {
  document.getElementById("loans").innerHTML = "";
  axios
    .get(
      "https://localhost:8080/api/loans/" + sessionStorage.getItem("email")
    )
    .then(res => {
      for (var i = 0; i < res.data.length; i++) {
        this.setState({
          _id: res.data[i]._id,
          amount: res.data[i].amount,
          date: res.data[i].date,
          status: res.data[i].status,
          owedTo: res.data[i].owedTo
        });
        //create LI element then form statment then append to LI then add to list
        var node = document.createElement("LI");
        var text = document.createTextNode(
          "Amount: €" +
            this.state.amount +
            ", \tDate: " +
            this.state.date +
            " ,\tStatus: " +
            this.state.status +
            " ,\tOwed to: " +
            this.state.owedTo
        );
        var buttonNode = document.createElement("Button");
        buttonNode.textContent = "Pay Back";
        buttonNode.id = "payButton";
        //for repaying loans
        var loanId = this.state._id;
        var loanCost = this.state.amount;
        //create new balance
        const newBalance = {
          balance: parseInt(
            sessionStorage.getItem("balance") - parseInt(this.state.amount)
          )
        };
        buttonNode.addEventListener("click", function() {
          //check if balance >= loanpayment
          if (sessionStorage.getItem("balance") >= loanCost) {
            axios
              .post(
                "https://localhost:8080/api/users/" +
                  sessionStorage.getItem("email") +
                  "/balance",
                newBalance
              )
              .then(res => {
                sessionStorage.setItem("balance", newBalance.balance);
                alert(
                  "Loan repaid new balance is: " +
                    sessionStorage.getItem("balance")
                );
              });
            axios
              .delete(
                "https://localhost:8080/api/loans/" +
                  sessionStorage.getItem("email") +
                  "/" +
                  loanId
              )
              .then(res => {
                alert("Loan paid");
              })
              .catch(error => {
                alert("error: " + error);
              });
            sessionStorage.setItem("openLoans", getOpenLoans());
            const newTransaction = {
              email: sessionStorage.getItem("email"),
              cost: -loanCost,
              location: "IndependentBanking.com",
              name: sessionStorage.getItem("username"),
              date: date
            };
            axios
              .post("https://localhost:8080/api/transactions", newTransaction)
              .then(res => {
                console.log(res);
              });
          } else {
            alert("Not enough money in account to repay loan");
          }
        });
        node.id = "loan";
        node.append(text);
        node.append(buttonNode);
        document.getElementById("loans").appendChild(node);
        sessionStorage.setItem("openLoans", getOpenLoans());
      }
    },
  )
    .catch(error => {
      alert("Could not get loans");
    });

}
\end{minted}
The getUserLoans() function creates a text node listing all pertinent information about the loan, it completes this by sending a get request via Axios to the Back-End and returns all loans on the user accounts.  It also creates a button that is appended to each loan which will offer the user a way to pay back the loan, once clicked the loan is deleted and the user balance is decremented by the loan amount if and only if the user has the loan amount in their balance, if not they are informed that they cannot pay back the loan.
\\
The getOpenLoans() function is used in two components Loans and UserInfo and is stored in a helper function, I used this to check if the user had open loans which is used when updating information and applying for loans I also check to see when the loan was last updated and if a week has passed, if a week has passed 0.1\% of the loan cost will be added to the total loan value. Here is the code below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
export function getOpenLoans() {
  var openLoan = 0;
  sessionStorage.setItem("openLoans", openLoan);
  var today = new Date();
  const axios = require("axios").default;
  //do update loan cost in here
  //helper function to count open loans and to add interest
  axios
    .get("https://localhost:8080/api/loans/" + sessionStorage.getItem("email"))
    .then(res => {
      for (var i = 0; i < res.data.length; i++) {
        if (res.data[i].status === "Open") {
          openLoan++;
        }
        sessionStorage.setItem("openLoans", openLoan);

        var loanUpdate = new Date(res.data[i].lastUpdate);
        //see how many weeks have past
        var weeks = Math.abs(Math.floor((today - loanUpdate) / 604800000));
        const newAmount = {
          amount: parseInt(
            Math.round(
              res.data[i].amount +
                (res.data[i].amount * (0.1 * Math.round(weeks)))
            )
          )
        };
        //checks if more than 1 week has passed since last interest was added
        if (
          weeks >= 1
        ) {


          const lastUpdate = {
            lastUpdate: today
          };
          axios
            .post(
              "https://localhost:8080/api/loans/" +
                sessionStorage.getItem("email") +
                "/" +
                res.data[i]._id +
                "/amount",
              newAmount
            )
            .then(res => {
            })
            .catch(err => {
              alert("issue adding interest: " + err);
            });
          axios
            .post(
              "https://localhost:8080/api/loans/" +
                sessionStorage.getItem("email") +
                "/" +
                res.data[i]._id +
                "/date",
              lastUpdate
            )
            .then(res => {

             })
            .catch(err => {
              alert("issue with dates: " + err);
            });
        } else {
          console.log("No interest ;D");
        }
      }
    })
    .catch(error => {
      alert("error getting loans: " + error);
    });
  return openLoan;
}
\end{minted}
The function goes through all the users loans and checks for the status open then sets a sessionStorage item to the amount of open loans the user has on their account.  It uses the user email as a parameter when communicating with the Back-End to ensure that the user is only judged by their own account information as opposed to any other user's information.  It is in this way that the user accounts are kept independent.  It also checks the difference between the dates from the current date and when the loan was last updated, it then determines if more than a week has passed since the last date and increases the loans value by 0.1\%.

\subsection{Home}
The home page is the first page that the user sees when they login to the application, it consists of a section to send money and another section listing the latest headlines from NewsAPI.org.  The send money section is used to send money to other independent banking accounts using their username so for example to send money to the user ultankearns@gmail.com I would enter that email into the input box account ID and the amount to send into the box prompting the user to send that amount.  The home page also lists the users current balance which is retrieved using an Axios get request to the Back-End.
\\
The send money feature works as follows, the user inputs the values expected, if the user exists then update the current users value to equal their balance - cost sent then update the other users balance to equal their balance + cost sent and create transactions for both the user sending the money and the user receiving the money.  Here is the code below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
if (this.state.accountId === sessionStorage.getItem("email")) {
  alert("Cannot send money to yourself ( ;-( )");
  e.preventDefault();
  return;
}
if (this.state.amount === "" || this.state.accountId === "") {
  alert(
    "The amount / account ID cannot be null, want to donate it to us? >;D"
  );
}
if (
  parseInt(this.state.amount) <=
    parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem("balance")) &&
  parseInt(this.state.amount) > 0
) {
  var date = new Date();
  //update bal
  const newBalance = {
    balance:
      parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem("balance")) -
      parseInt(this.state.amount)
  };
  sessionStorage.setItem("balance", newBalance.balance);

  axios
    .post(
      "https://localhost:8080/api/users/" +
        sessionStorage.getItem("email") +
        "/balance",
      newBalance
    )
    .catch(error => {
      alert("Could not send money");
    });

  //payer logic
  const newTransaction = {
    email: sessionStorage.getItem("email"),
    cost: this.state.amount * -1,
    location: "Online Banking Transfer to " + this.state.accountId,
    name: sessionStorage.getItem("username"),
    date: date
  };
  //create transaction
  axios
    .post("https://localhost:8080/api/transactions", newTransaction)
    .then(res => {
      console.log(res);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      alert("ERROR");
    });
  //payee logic
  const payeeTransaction = {
    email: this.state.accountId,
    cost: this.state.amount,
    location:
      "Online Banking Transfer from " + sessionStorage.getItem("email"),
    name: sessionStorage.getItem("username"),
    date: date
  };
  //create transaction
  axios
    .post("https://localhost:8080/api/transactions", payeeTransaction)
    .then(res => {
      console.log(res);
    })
    .catch(error => {
      alert("ERROR");
    });
  axios
    .get("https://localhost:8080/api/users/" + this.state.accountId)
    .then(res => {
      this.setState({
        payeeBalance:
          parseInt(res.data.balance) + parseInt(this.state.amount)
      });
    })
    .catch(error => {
      alert("ERROR");
    })
    .then(res => {
      const newBalance = {
        balance: this.state.payeeBalance
      };
      axios
        .post(
          "https://localhost:8080/api/users/" +
            this.state.accountId +
            "/balance",
          newBalance
        )
        .then(res => {
          //not doing this after 3 attemps
          document.getElementById("balance").innerHTML =
            "Your balance: €" + sessionStorage.getItem("balance");
          alert(
            "Money Sent to: " +
              this.state.accountId +
              " Amount sent: " +
              this.state.amount +
              " New Balance: " +
              sessionStorage.getItem("balance")
          );
        })
        .catch(error => {
          alert("ERROR");
        });
    })
    .catch(error => {
      alert("ERROR " + error);
    });
} else {
  alert("Transaction failed");
}
e.preventDefault();
};
\end{minted}
The above feature contains the logic both for the payer and the payee.
\\
To get the headlines and the balance was very simple to get the balance I simply performed an axios get request as we have seen before in other components, to get the headlines was slightly harder as I had to format the data and create elements using the DOM(Document object model) as shown below, which is located in a helper file:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
axios
  .get(
    "https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&category=business&apiKey=e9cdf3a801374e4eba79b8ea0552a4bd"
  )
  .then(res => {
    for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      //create LI element then form statment then append to LI then add to list
      var node = document.createElement("LI");
      node.id = "headline";
      var text = document.createTextNode(
        "Headline: " +
          res.data.articles[i].title +
          "Description: " +
          res.data.articles[i].description +
          "Author: " +
          res.data.articles[i].author
      );
      var image = document.createElement("IMG");
      image.src = res.data.articles[i].urlToImage;
      image.alt = "Picture not available";
      var link = document.createElement("A");
      link.href = res.data.articles[i].url;
      link.text = "Link to article";
      node.append(text);
      node.append(link);
      node.append(image);
      document.getElementById("homeFinance").appendChild(node);
    }
    ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
  })
  .catch(error => {});
\end{minted}
This basically retrieves the information and creates an element on the page which then displays all pertinent headlines to the user.

\subsection{Statistics}
The statistics page shows the user information pertaining to the stock market which is retrieved using the
alphavantage API.  The alphavantage API has a five calls per minute limitation for free users so if the
max call limit is reached the application informs the user by displaying a message.  This component also utilizes
Chart.JS which is a JavaScript library to create different types of mathematical charts so that the user can
see a visual aid to view their spending habits.  Every time a loan is taken out or there is any activity on the users
account the charts will update.
\\
The information about the stock market is retrieved using an Axios get request and creating text elements via the DOM which we
have seen used in previous components here is the code below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
axios
  .get(
    "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=MSFT&apikey=G38RVCM1OWLSKALP"
  )
  .then(res => {
    var d = res.data["Meta Data"]["3. Last Refreshed"];
    d = d.split(" ")[0];
    var node = document.createElement("LI");
    node.id = "stockresults";

    var text = document.createTextNode(
      "Stats for today: Open: " +
        res.data["Time Series (Daily)"][d]["1. open"] +
        " High: " +

The above code just retrieves information from the API and formats it in a way that is readable to the user
the code also includes error handling in case of a network error or API error.
\\
The code for the data chart just retrieves information about the user account by using axios get requests to get the
transactions and loans on the user account which I will show below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
async updateLoanData() {
  await axios
    .get(
      "https://localhost:8080/api/loans/" + sessionStorage.getItem("email")
    )
    .then(res => {
      console.log(res.data);
      var newLoanState = this.state.loanState;
      for (var i = 0; i < res.data.length; i++) {
        newLoanState.datasets[0].data[i] = res.data[i].amount;
        newLoanState.labels[i] = res.data[i].amount;
      }
      this.setState({
        loanState: newLoanState
      });
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      alert("Error generating loans " + error);
    });
}
async updateTransactionData() {
  return axios
    .get(
      "https://localhost:8080/api/transactions/" +
        sessionStorage.getItem("email")
    )
    .then(res => {
      var newTransactionState = this.state.transactionState;
      for (var i = 0; i < res.data.length; i++) {
        newTransactionState.datasets[0].data[i] = res.data[i].cost;
        newTransactionState.labels[i] = res.data[i].location;
      }
      this.setState({
        transactionState: newTransactionState
      });
    })
    .catch(function(error) {
      alert("Error generating transactions " + error);
    });
}
\end{minted}
The above code just feeds the retrieved data into a variable called transactionState and loanState depending on which method
is called.

\label{fig:Image of statistics component}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Transactions}
The transactions component lists transactions made on this users account which means it
will list every transfer, loan or loan repayment made on the users account.  It accomplishes
this by using an axios get request to the Back-End and utilizing the user email to return all
there transactions.  Here is the code for requesting the transactions below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
  componentDidMount() {
    const axios = require("axios").default;
    //use email instead
    axios
      .get(
        "https://localhost:8080/api/transactions/" +
          sessionStorage.getItem("email")
      )
      .then(res => {
        for (var i = 0; i < res.data.length; i++) {
          this.setState({
            location: res.data[i].location,
            cost: res.data[i].cost,
            name: res.data[i].name,
            date: res.data[i].date,
            email: res.data[i].email
          });
          //create LI element then form statment then append to LI then add to list
          var node = document.createElement("LI");
          var text = document.createTextNode(
            "Location: " +
              this.state.location +
              ", Cost: €" +
              this.state.cost +
              ", Name: " +
              this.state.name +
              ", Date: " +
              this.state.date
          );
          node.id = "transaction"
          node.append(text);
          document.getElementById("transactions").appendChild(node);
        }
      }).catch(error =>{
        alert("Can't get transactions issue connecting to server")
      });

  }
\end{minted}
Once retrieved each transaction is added to the transactions list as a child and is viewable by the user.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=5cm]{img/transactionscomponent.png}
\caption{Image of Transactions Component}
\label{fig:Image of transactions component}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Headlines}
The headlines component gets the latest headlines from Reddit and NewsAPI and returns them to the user
the headlines component utilizes the same helper method as in home but this component has a lot more
stories and also retrieves the latest headlines from Reddit /r/wallstreet which are retrieved utilizing
the Reddit API as demonstrated in the code below:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
axios
  .get(
    "https://www.Reddit.com/r/wallstreet/.json"
  )
  .then(res => {
    for (var i = 0; i < res.data.data.children.length; i++) {
      var node = document.createElement("LI");
      node.id = "reddit_headlines";
      var text = document.createTextNode(
          "Headline: " + res.data.data.children[i].data.title + " " + res.data.data.children[i].data.selftext
      );
      var link = document.createElement("A");
      link.href = res.data.data.children[i].data.url
      link.text = "Link to article";
      var image = document.createElement("IMG");
      image.src = res.data.data.children[i].data.thumbnail
      image.alt = "Picture not available";
      image.height = res.data.data.children[i].data.thumbnail_height
      image.width = res.data.data.children[i].data.thumbnail_width
      node.append(text)
      node.append(link)
      node.append(image)
      document.getElementById("Reddit").appendChild(node);
    }
   }).catch(error => {
     alert("Having issues getting your news from Reddit")
   });
\end{minted}
\\
This is basically the same function as we have seen from the helper method in the home component with the
exception that it has different field names as opposed to newsapi.org, but essentially they function the
exact same way.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/headlinescomponent.png}
\caption{Image of Headlines Component}
\label{fig:Image of headlines component}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Error}
The error page is a simple page which handles errors which may occur when the user tries to
access a resource that may not exist and it returns a message stating to the user "Sorry this page cannot be found"
and also has a header which says "Error 404", a 404 error is returned when the server cannot find a requested resource.
\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/errorcomponent.png}
\caption{Image of Error Component}
\label{fig:Image of Error component}
\end{figure}
\subsection{About}
The about section just displays information about the site to the user and features no Back-End logic or axios requests
its sole purpose is to make the bank appear as if it were a real entity instead of an imaginary business which only
exists in the mind of a college student.  Of course all businesses start as imaginary entities and through hard work
and effort become real viable businesses.

\end{figure}
\subsection{UserInfo}
The UserInfo component has a large level of complexity, upon loading the user is
greeted with a section for their basic info, a section for updating their info,
and a delete account section aptly placed in what Kenny Loggins refers to as the "Danger Zone".
The UserInfo component works by firstly sending a get request to the Back-End to retrieve user info,
next in the update section it retrieves all pertinent user info from across all schemas and
updates the foreign keys which in most cases happens to be the username(User email).  The delete function
finds all the information pertinent to the user across various schemas using the user's email as
a parameter to the get requests and deletes all the user information that we have stored.
\\
Code for the get function:
\begin{minted}[linenos,tabsize=2,breaklines]{JavaScript}
updateData() {
  axios
    .get("https://localhost:8080/api/users/" + this.state.username)
    .then(res => {
      var text = document.createTextNode(
        "Name: " +
          res.data.name +
          " Number: " +
          res.data.number +
          " Date of Birth: " +
          res.data.dob +
          " Username: " +
          res.data._id +
          " Balance: " +
          res.data.balance,

        //In case user leaves any information blank just submit their current info

        this.setState({
          prevName: res.data.name
        }),
        this.setState({
          prevNumber: res.data.number

\subsection{Support}
The support component consists of a paragraph describing the component, a textarea where the user can enter bugs, and a button.  The goal of the support component is that the user can send a bug report to the development team and then hopefully be fixed.

\section{Designing for UX(User Experience)}
UX is very important for an application as nobody wants to use an application that looks unsafe or looks clunky, so in this section I will be discussing how I tried to avoid coding a bad Front-End design and the methodology I took when designing the Front-End.
\subsection{Designing For End-Users As Opposed to Engineers}
In making decisions regarding the UI I took user experience into serious consideration,
I have noticed a growing tendency among web developers to make sites as minimalistic as
possible so not to overwhelm the user, sites such as 9Gag, Reddit, Twitter \& Facebook
all employ this design choice as they hide more complex action behind settings menus
and other menus as opposed to greeting the user with them and overwhelming the user.  I have also decided to
make the website aesthetically pleasing as most users judge a site by it's initial
impact on them, in other words if a site has a black background and red text the user
is not likely to trust it.
\\
The user experience is extremely important for a banking application in particular,
as banking apps tend to have many complex features which can be hidden behind layers
of abstraction to abstract away the complexity of Back-End logic from the Front-End.
The user need not know how the Back-End logic works to perform any function on the
site and any pertinent stipulations ,which are entirely arbitrary, are described via
alerts or on the page itself.
\\
The engineer tends to have a mind which values high degrees of complexity whereas
the user values lower degrees of complexity, which is why I say I designed this
application more for the user rather than the engineer.
\\
In short I have abstracted away complex features, made the website minimalistic,
made it aesthetically pleasing, and tried to be as concise with my language as
possible to develop a user-friendly banking system which is on of the objectives
I have outlined in my original project objectives.
\section{Back-End Architecture}
Back-End architecture is concerned with the logical aspect of the application such as the routes, communication with the database, and describing the internal logic of the application.  In this section I will discuss how I designed the Back-End architecture it's components and how they all fit together to provide a litany of functions to perform a number of banking tasks.
\subsection{Mongoose}
Mongoose is a modelling tool for MongoDB and I utilized it on the Back-End to create schemas, create objects, read data, update data and delete data. Mongoose was very useful in communicating with the database and allowed me to create custom features which could be utilized to search for various objects using their parameters.  All requests made to the database were made using Mongoose to achieve a full CRUD(Create, Read, Update \& delete) application.
\subsection{ExpressJS}
ExpressJS provided a thin layer which sat on top of NodeJS and provided me with desirable features such as saving me the effort of specifying the full URL of the server on the Back-End and instead using the relative path to the resources I needed.  It also provided a body parser so I could return JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) objects which made manipulating data coming from the server incredibly easy, and in this way I was able to provide the user with the pertinent information they needed and format said information easily and effectively.
\subsection{NodeJS}
NodeJS provided a framework to build the server-side architecture and made creating and designing the Back-End for this application both easy and enjoyable.  NodeJS has various benefits which it provided to the application such as being open source, cross-platform and it utilizes JavaScript which is one of the most popular languages for web-based development, which means various programmers can work and improve upon my original design.

\section{RESTful Architecture}
RESTful architecture has many benefits and is widely used in modern applications, in this section I will describe RESTful architecture and it's benefits.
\subsection{Client / Server Independence}
To ensure that RESTful architecture standards were met I had to keep the client
and the server independent.  I did this by making use of the AXIOS HTTP client which
I used to send requests from the client side to the server side, in this way I ensured
that the server and the client were completely independent of each other.  Axios acted
as a middle layer which was used whenever the client needed to communicate with the server.
Axios returned responses, sent GET, POST, PUT, DELETE and other HTTP requests to the server
and returned results from numerous APIS which I used in this project.
\subsection{Cacheable}
I made use of sessionStorage on the client machine to perform various Back-End logic and
used this stored information to pass parameters to Axios so that it could retrieve user information,
perform authentication, send information about the user to the server, update information and create new resources.
\\
In addition to caching user information on the client machine the entire website is also cacheable, as it is a single page
application and once loaded the user does not have to wait for pages to load as thanks to AJAX(Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
the requested resources are loaded almost instantaneously.
\subsection{Stateless}
As mentioned in the cacheable section I made great use of sessionStorage to store information on the client machine, this information was then used in axios requests when communicating with the server, the server did not maintain a user session as the server and client were entirely independent of each other.  If the server went down the users application would still load but the user would not be able to login or perform any Back-End functions such as sending HTTP requests.  Statelessness is an important part of RESTful architecture and I did my utmost to achieve and implement it into this project so as to create a fully RESTful application.
\section{Database Architecture}
Database architecture can make or break a project, that is why I utilized MLAB and broke the database up into schemas so it is easily manageable.  I will discuss the database architecture in further detail below.
\subsection{MLAB}
MLAB is a DAAS or Database As A Service application which I used to store all the information about users or any other information
generated by the application.  The Database was accessed using Mongoose on the Back-End.  The database is encrypted and secure and is used by
various companies such as Toyota, Facebook \& Lyft just to name a few.  I chose MLAB for this project in order to make the database more secure
and to imitate a real-life application as very few companies own their own servers to host their data, many companies off for IAAS \& DAAS as they are far more scalable and inexpensive both in terms of time \& cost.
\subsection{Schema of Database}
\begin{figure}[hb]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/databasediagram.png}
\caption{Image of Database Schema}
\label{fig:Image of Database Schema}
\end{figure}
\section{Security}
Security is a major concern with an online banking system, I will describe how I secured the application to the best of my abilities below.
\subsection{Overview of Security}
The application is secured using HTTPS(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) which encrypts connections to the application and the server
is secured using SHA256(Secure Hashing Algorithm) and the users passwords are encrypted with SHA256 as well.  The application complies with the most up to date cyber-security principles and offers the user protection from hackers and implements security features expected of a modern online banking application.
\\
The certificates I used on the server were generated using OpenSSL, both the application and the server use self-signed certificates which will generate security warnings in Chrome and Firefox as the browser doesn't know if the certificates were verified by a reputable source, in a real world deployment I would have used GoDaddy or another service to verify the certificates.
\chapter{System Evaluation}
\section{Robust}
It was very important from the outset that this application be robust as it is a basic requirement expected from any legitimate online banking application in the 21st century, I will list how I accomplished robustness below.
\subsection{Error Handling}
I have tested each feature extensively and have performed error handling where appropriate,
the application is not entirely bug-free which is to be expected as no complex piece of software
is wholly bug free.  I performed error handling on all inputs and with all axios requests and have
minimized the chances of errors occurring by utilizing TDD principles and refactoring and testing
the code extensively.  There are some known errors which occur within the system that I was not able to
rectify these are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sometimes when applying for multiple loans the user does not see any message or verification of loan
  \item Sometimes the update function may not execute correctly to rectify this logout and login again.
\end{itemize}
\\
Although some issues do exist the application functions fairly well, I will not assume my code is 100\%
error free as no complex application is 100\% error free.  I will say I have tested the application extensively
and can assure the user that the bugs that do exist are easily rectified.
\subsection{Testing}
I utilized Selenium to perform automated testing on the application in this way I was able to perform
integration and regression testing on each module and feature implemented in this application.  I have
found many bugs in the application which I recorded during my development and can be viewed on the issues section
of the projects GitHub repository.  Testing the application was not easy as there are many places where a full-stack
banking application or indeed any full-stack application can fail, I mitigated the long hours of testing by utilizing
Selenium and outputting error messages to the console.
\\
Selenium had a great impact on this project and made performing integration and regression tests a lot faster and easier as I did not have to input information over and over again.
\subsection{Speed}
The applications components load very fast and the data is retrieved with little waiting time, there may be a slight slow down when accessing components such as Headlines or Statistics as these components make calls to third party APIs to retrieve data from various websites.  The application is cacheable and thanks to the RESTful design it does not depend on constant calls to the server and in this way the loading of components becomes a lot faster and barely noticeable to the user.
\section{Accessibility}
In this project usability and accessibility were my main concerns, I wanted an application that the user could take to their grandmother and have her figure it out with little to no effort.  I will reflect on how I emphasized accessibility in this project below.
\subsection{Minimalistic}
In this application I provided a minimalistic UI so as not to overwhelm the user
with a lot of on screen elements which many users will find superfluous especially
if they are not used to complicated technology.  I aimed to provide an accessible
site that anyone could use and I feel that I have completed that to a fair degree.

I will include some statements from friends who I've showed the app to below:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jason - I like the sleek and minimalistic design and it does not take long to load.
\item James - It has a very modern aesthetic and it has very fast load times and is easy to get my head around how to use it.
\item Liam - It's very intuitive and the UI is very minimalistic which I like as it does not require a lot of thought to figure out.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Intuitive}
I wanted to make the application intuitive to use so I avoided using complicated or technical jargon and instead explained to the user the functions of the pages and how to utilize the functionality of the page.  I also avoided using complicated names for each component and made it so the components name describes what you'd expect to see on the component.
\section{Objectives}
In this section I will go over the objectives I laid out in chapter 2 and talk about how I completed each individual objective.
\subsection{Safe \& Secure Banking}
The project is encrypted with HTTPS and the Back-End is secured using Transport
Layer Security(TLS) which is the latest in security standards.  The user passwords
are all secured utilizing the SHA256 algorithm so that not even the system administrators,
who have access to all the user's information, cannot even find out the users plaintext
password.  In addition to this the user can also recover an account if they know their email
by visiting the forgot page which will store a new password as a hash in the database and
then email it to them using encryption.
\\
Due to the aforementioned security methods being employed I am convinced that the
banking application is safe and secure and cannot be hacked without significant knowledge
and effort.
\\
I also added 2 factor authentication using Twilio which sends a ten digit number to the user's phone
which is required to login thus greatly increasing the security of the users account.
\subsection{User Generated Statistics}
This project utilizes ChartJS which is a JavaScript library which will generate
user statistics based upon their interaction with the application.  The application
pulls user data from the database and displays the users loans and transactions as
bar charts which were utilized to provide the user with a visual aid that will show
them how many loans they have taken out and their transactions which can be either
positive or negative.
\subsection{Multiple Users}
The application supports multiple users at once which are all independent of each
other.  The statistics page may yield some problems with multiple users as the
API limits free users to a maximum of five API calls a minute, users who are unfortunate
to not be the first to click the button will be greeted with error messages informing them
that they cannot retrieve the data.  Despite the statistics page being a problem all other
components function as normal when dealing with multiple users and thanks to a restful API
design the users are fully separated from each other which ensures that the user will not
impact any other users experience, unless they perform DDOS or man in the middle attacks.
\subsection{RestFUL Principles}
RestFUL principles were fully taken into consideration when designing this application,
the application is stateless and cacheable and the client and server are entirely independent of each other.
\\
 The server does not store any information
about the user and merely connects to a database to perform CRUD functionality, the
Front-End makes HTTP calls through a HTTP client and in this way I was able to ensure
client server Independence.
\\
The application is cacheable as single page applications are cached on the users
device and this drastically reduces load times.
\\
The application is stateless as it does not maintain any state but instead uses
user information as parameters which are passed into HTTP calls to retrieve, update,
create and delete data.
\subsection{Scalable}
The application scales well and functions which are utilized in more than one component
were put into helper functions which follows the DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
which is a major tenant of software development and also makes the application more
maintainable as functions don't have to be reprogrammed and can instead be imported from
a file.
\\
The applications code was also written with reuse and scalability in mind that is why
I have commented lines of code which may be hard for others who work on the project to
understand.
\subsection{Responsive}
The application is responsive and thanks to it being a Single Page Application load times are
practically non-existent as the application is cached on the users device meaning that the
user does not have to wait for a http request to retrieve the information but instead can access
it from their own device.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{What I Learned}
I learned a great many things from developing this project, I learned an awful lot about developing an application using professional and industry standards to create a full-stack application.  I will list the things I have learned from this project below.
\subsection{React}
I learned a lot about React during this project as I have never used it before but I
have used a similar framework which was somewhat helpful but I found React a lot different
from Angular.
\\
I also learned a lot about various different React libraries such as the one I used to
hash the user's passwords and the ones I used to style the application.
\\
React also taught me a lot about learning to learn as I had to learn the framework
relatively quickly and I found that the skill of learning to learn was more important
than anything else when I decided to use this framework.
\subsection{NodeJS}
NodeJS taught me a lot about Back-End design and how difficult it can be to think about
an application logically and break it down into schemas and function calls and how full-
stack applications function in the real world.  I have utilized NodeJS on a previous project
but my knowledge of NodeJS was nowhere near what it is now thanks to undertaking this application.
\\
I believe that I have learned more about how a server functions and how it should be designed from this
project and especially since banking applications have many areas where you can encourage failure in the
system, I learned how to avoid these areas and in places where I failed to avoid these errors the ensuing
headaches served as a reminder not to make these errors again.
\subsection{Docker}
I had never utilized Docker before undertaking this project and it taught me an
awful lot about continuous integration and continuous deployment.  Docker made it
extremely easy to automate my builds of the project and ensure that the image hosted
on the Docker container was always the latest version of the project.  I was able to
set up the container in such a way that every push to my main branch on Github would
automatically trigger a new build and update the version of the project stored in the
image Docker generates.
\\
I will now be employing Docker in all future projects as it is an extremely useful tool
for making sure that a project is following Agile principles
which I will be recommending to every developer I meet.
\subsection{Scope Creep}
Scope creep was very hard to manage in this project as online banking applications
are constantly being improved upon and the number of features are growing exponentially, in fact
one of the sites I have mentioned in this dissertation(Online Banking 365) was updated while I was
in the process of writing this dissertation!
\\
There were many features which I wished to add to the application but sadly time did not permit it,
one of these features was an online chat bot which you could ask to help you in understanding the application
and how to better interact with it, sadly not all desired features can be implemented in an application but I included the
features I felt were most important.
\\
Scope creep had a very negative impact on this project as I found the number of features growing and I still had
to test previous features and features that were in the process of being implemented.
\\
From this project I learned that scope creep should be identified early and combated by assigning a weight to a feature depending on its importance and prioritising features with higher weights as opposed to those with lower weights.
\\
Below I will include a list of the best ways I found to combat scope creep:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Careful Planning - This tip cannot be stressed enough I found that the components I planned out carefully were less likely to fall prey to scope-creep.
  \item Utilizing test driven development - This helps as it allows for implementing the feature first then going back and refactoring it which saves a lot of time in implementing a myriad of features.
  \item Focus on the most important features first - This was a great help in combating scope-creep in the development process.  I laid out features in order of importance in my mind and focused entirely on testing them and making sure they were implemented well.  After I focused on less important features and worked on implementing and testing them.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{The Stackoverflow Principle: READ THE DOCS!}
You may be wondering about the reasoning behind the naming of this section and I will be happy to explain it before we delve into the main point of this very pertinent subsection of my dissertation.  Some developers have a tendency to remonstrate new developers with the platitude we are all familiar with "READ THE DOCS!".  This is however good advice if the documentation is well-written although experienced developers will know that often some documentation can be poorly written, however I was blessed with well-written documentation which was a pleasure to read and the above platitude can sometimes turn out to be good advice.  So in short do not give way to the pretense of knowledge but rather embrace your ignorance and assume you know nothing and in that way you can improve and learn.  This chapter is dedicated to teaching developers to READ THE DOCS!
\\
This is a point I cannot stress enough,  I find that most developers(including myself) think that they are almighty and that they do not need to read the documentation which is a gross error.  I found that I wasted a lot of time which could have been used improving the application on silly little errors which I introduced thanks to my ignorance of concepts I could have learned about in the documentation.
\\
Luckily I was able to realize the mistakes I was making early on in the development cycle and I took two weeks off to research the project and which technologies I would use and how best to implement them.  I read up on each technology I was utilizing in this application and reviewed their documentation and how to best implement these technologies.
\\
I found that reading the documentation saved so much time during the development of this project and reading documentation is not something that should ever be understated.
\section{Innovation}
Throughout this project I have tried to make the application as innovative as possible by treating the application as if it were a real online banking system, I have added a number of desired features which I will explain below.
\\
I aimed to improve upon the online banking systems of today by adding these features / functions, many of which I have not personally seen implemented in banking systems currently.
\subsection{Headlines}
When using online banking I have noticed that many banks do not offer the latest financial news or that they only offer news from their own bank, this is in my view a mistake.  While there may be security reasons why most banks due this such as an aversion to CORS(cross origin resources sharing) which is understandable as it may lead to cross site scripting,  I have tried my utmost best to ensure this application provides a secure way of utilizing CORS by implementing HTTPS \& SSL/TLS into the system.  The headlines I used come from a myriad of news sources and by utilizing not only NewsAPI but also Reddit's financial subreddit I believe that I have provided a great service to the user by showing them various sources of new information which will enhance the end-users banking experience.  I have tried my utmost to ensure that these news sources were unbiased and fairly distributed across the political spectrum, although I will say a lot of news outlets have a strong bias either to the left or right of the political spectrum, this is not a limitation of the application rather the APIs it depends on to retrieve the news.
\subsection{Voice Recognition}
Voice recognition was a late addition to the code and thankfully Annyang(the library I utilized for this application to provide voice recognition)\cite{Annyang} was very easy to setup and even easier to user.  Voice Recognition is not available in many online banking systems and the reason may well be grounded in reasonable security concerns.  I have limited the functionality of voice recognition in this application to only navigation only as bad actors may try to take out loans on the users behalf or to transfer funds to their own accounts.
\\
Voice recognition in the application is fairly intuitive just say the component you would like and it will navigate to it whilst hiding the navigation bar which is deemed redundant in what I termed "Voice Mode".  If the user is stuck or does not understand Voice Mode they can utilize the help command which will show them all the available commands in Voice Mode. Voice mode can be turned off by logging out of the application and logging into the application again.
\section{How TDD \& Agile Impacted Development}
Both TDD and agile were crucial to the development and success of this project, there is a reason why both methodologies are utilized in industry and it is not hard to see why after having practiced them.
\subsection{Positive Impacts of TDD}
Test driven development had an extremely positive effect on the development of this application, while I was coding I began to think like a tester as opposed to a developer and thought just how much code is necessary to make this test pass then after I wrote the code I began to refactor it and found that I coded better this way.
\\
TDD was very useful when designing functions which had a high possibility of failure such as the loans and update functions which tended to fail more often than other features I implemented in this application.  TDD really simplified the problems encountered when designing functions as I was not thinking how best to design the function but rather how to just make it pass.  I worried about optimization after I was sure the code was working and wasn't error prone.
\subsection{Positive Impacts of Agile \& Kanban}
Agile and Kanban were a tremendous success in this project as most of the sprints were on time or were completed before time.  I found that by following agile principles that I was able to design this application a lot faster than I would have using another methodology such as waterfall.
\\
Agile allowed me to revisit modules and test them to ensure that they were error free and were fit for purpose.  Agile also helped me to think about continuous integration and delivery for the application which I achieved using Docker.
\\
Agile also helped me to plan for the implementation of various functionality which would be needed for a full-stack banking application and helped me to implement said functionality in a timely-manner and also to decide which functionality needed to be implemented first.
\\
The Kanban board on Github which I utilized for this project was a tremendous help in coordinating my sprints and I found it helped me keep on top of this project even when I had a very heavy workload.
\\
In conclusion agile \& Kanban had an extremely positive impact on this application and saved a lot of time during development.
\section{What I Would Do Differently}
Although the development of this application went relatively smoothly thanks in part to the utilization of Agile \& TDD and the guidance of the project supervisor Dr. Dominic Carr there are some things that I would have done differently if given the opportunity to start again.
\subsection{Planning}
Looking back in hindsight there were a lot of things that I could have done differently, personally I feel the biggest change I would have made would have been to focus more on the planning phase and drew up a more detailed design of each function before implementation.  During the development I did describe functions I wanted but these functions were typically described in a couple of sentences without much thought, if I were doing this application again I would have wrote about three paragraphs stating exactly the function was supposed to do and how it should look to the user.
\\
I feel I wasted a lot of time implementing features which were planned poorly and if I had just taken some time out to plan for these functions I would have had a much easier time implementing them.  That being said the planning phase did go fairly well compared to previous projects I worked on thanks to my adherence to Agile principles and TDD(Test Driven Development).
\subsection{More Focus on AI}
Given that AI is a major field of study and a growing field I regret not having implemented it into this project.  I originally had a plan to utilize Tensorflow JS in this project but due to time-constraints this feature was never implemented.
\\
I feel a lot of regret about not being able to integrate AI into this application as it would have been a major upgrade to the standard banking application but there's always next time.
\section{In Closing}
In closing this application taught me a lot about how to apply my programming skills to make a fully functional online banking application.  It taught me how to design an intuitive UI with a strong emphasis on UX, it thought me to think logically, to design clearly, to read carefully and to document religiously.  I feel that in my four years at GMIT I have learned a lot about programming, life and myself,  I have learned to think like a developer and to place a strong emphasis on quality over quantity in regards to developing good software,  I believe it was in the book the Pragmatic Programmer where they stated "write something you can be proud to put your name on" I am proud to put my name on this application and I am proud to call it my own.  I wish to thank all the lecturers at GMIT who have helped to cultivate and teach me how to improve my skills not only as a developer but as a student of many diverse areas of knowledge in the realm of computer science.
\\
This is the end of a long journey and one that has taught me so much about everything that I did not know.
\section{Final Words}
Thank you so much for taking a look at my Final Year Project, it has been a long four years at GMIT and I have learned so much in a diverse range of topics which encompass what is termed as Computer Science. I used to see software engineering as just the ability to crack out code but I now know that it is so much more than that, to truly be a software engineer you must be first and foremost a problem solver, to be able to tackle a diverse set of problems and to design elegant applications and solutions and to come up with clever ways to overcome technical, financial and communicative barriers to deliver a final product to the end user. Software engineering has truly become a passion of mine as opposed to just being a hobbyist / student, I truly feel that these four years have been life changing and have helped me to change and grow for the better.

I would like to extend a personal thanks to my supervisor Dr. Dominic Carr for advising me during the development of this project and for offering suggestions which I would not have thought of otherwise for instance the integration of Twilio was brought about at Dr. Carr's suggestion.

I would also like to extend my thanks and gratitude to all of the lecturers at GMIT who have helped me in various ways throughout these long and arduous four years. It is thanks to the brilliant and talented staff at GMIT that I was able to create an application such as this.

Finally I wish to extend my thanks to the external examiners who will be grading this project, thank you for looking through my code and I hope that you find the documentation and the code itself up to the rigorous academic standards.

In this last paragraph I wish to leave you with a quote, from what I view as the greatest Scientist of all time, Sir Isaac Newton: "If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants"\cite{Newton}.  I think this quote is a fitting end to this dissertation as it shows how much I have learned from some of the greatest lecturers in the field of Computer Science.
\\
Thank you for reading this dissertation.
\\
It is my sincerest hope that I gave you a detailed and extensive overview of the development process of my application - Ultan Kearns signing off.
