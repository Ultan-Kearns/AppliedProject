# IMPORTANT NOTES: 
+ All credit to Dr Ian Mcloughlin for providing the LaTeX template for this dissertation.
+ The images in this dissertation were not made by myself except the images of the application, the DB schema which was created using https://dbdiagram.io/home and the project schematic image.  All credit goes to the original image creators, sadly the images where hard to reference due to the authours name generally being obscure, you can find the original authours using reverse image search here: .https://tineye.com/

## Introduction

This section of the repo contains all the .tex files for my dissertation, I have chosen to keep all the sections in one .tex file as I wanted to edit multiple sections and didn't want to open too many tabs in my text editor.

## How to Compile

To use this, you should install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) and [Pygments](http://pygments.org/download/) (which requires Python).

You'll also need to run ```pdflatex``` with the ```--shell-escape``` option.
See [this Stack Exchange post](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/99475/how-to-invoke-latex-with-the-shell-escape-flag-in-texmakerx) for details.
