# Fourth Year Applied Project and Dissertation - Ultan Kearns G00343745 
This project was made by me for my fourth year module Applied Project and Dissertation,I have decided on making a baking app using React, Node, Express and MongoDB.  I have also chosen to integrate neo4j and python scripts into this project. My goal is to make a secure, fully functioning banking application which will provide the user with a rich UI, multiple banking features such as viewing statements and taking out loans and allow them to view expenditures using graphs made in python.  It is my hope that these tools will prove useful to the user and provide a satisfying experience.
